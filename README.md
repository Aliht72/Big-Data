# Big Data project

## Description
In this project, we use visualisation techniques to gain insights from various datasets. Additionally, we implement two machine learning algorithms, supervised and unsupervised, on a combined dataset.

## Visualisation
Visualisation in data science contains graphical and pictorial data that gives insight into datasets. This section shows some important information obtained from plots and figures of the above datasets.
Visualisation in this part is helped pandas and matplotlib libraries in python.

### Figure 4
Depicts the number of players' clicks on different ads by using the ad-clicks dataset. The different colours of each category represent different add-ids.
Computer and games ads had more clicks, more than 2500. Moreover, each category's number of add-id helped get more clicks among players.

### Figure 5
Illustrates the percentage of purchased items by using the buy-clicks dataset. It shows that item number 5 was the bestselling amongst other items, 57%.

### Figure 6
Shows the number of daily clicks by players. The plot shows that the number of clicks gradually increased in this period, and it can show either the number of players increased or players spent more time on the game.

### Figure 7
Illustrates how many players each team has for a specific assignment. As the bar graph shows, more than 400 teams have one player for a specific assignment, and it is almost equal to a team with four and five players, and more than 600 teams have more than six players.

### Figure 8
Shows how many times teams participated in each event. The below box plot depicts 50% of teams that participated in five or more events, and just one team participated in one event.

### Figure 9
Illustrates the percentage of the type of devices that players used. Most players used iPhone devices,41.9%, and 35.4% played with the Android products.
This figure shows the diversity of players globally and was drawn by Powerbi software. The heatmap shows that the Catch pink flamingo game is more popular in Europe, South Asia, and South America.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. (Selig, 2022)
Most data scientists divide machine learning techniques into three different models: Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement.
This paper implemented one supervised and one unsupervised machine learning techniques on combined dataset.

### Unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised is a machine learning technique that uses algorithms to analyse and cluster unlabeled datasets.
This section uses the combined dataset to cluster players who had a purchase in the game by utilising the K-mean method.

### Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised machine learning uses labelled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or accurately predict outcomes.
The decision tree algorithm was deployed for the classification of the combined dataset.

## Code
You can find the code for this project on GitHub: https://github.com/Aliht72/Big-Data.

## How to Run
To run the code, you need to have the following libraries installed: pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries using pip.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides insights into various datasets using visualisation techniques and implementing machine learning algorithms. This project has practical implications for businesses that aim to maximise their profits and improve customer satisfaction.
